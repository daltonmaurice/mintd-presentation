Help me create a presentation for research lab to show how to use @/Users/mad265/git-pub/cooper-lab/mint/ and @/Users/mad265/git-pub/cooper-lab/mint-registry/  with implementation of @/Users/mad265/git-yale/cooper-lab/data-registry/ and @data-registry/catalog/data/data_cms-provider-data-service.yaml .

The presentation should be a quatro presnetation which provides

1. high level overview of the architecture 
2. how the pieces fit togethers
3. benefits of the framework 
4. examples of how to use from Stata 
5. planned implementation of an enclave repository
